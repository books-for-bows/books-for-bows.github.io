## Overview
Books for Bows is a web application that provides a market place for students to buy and sell textbooks directly to other students. It is built with the technology stack that consists of:

* [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/) for Javascript-based implementation of client and server code.
* [React](https://reactjs.org/) for component-based UI implementation and routing.
* [Semantic UI React](https://react.semantic-ui.com/) CSS Framework for UI design.
* [Uniforms](https://uniforms.tools/) for React and Semantic UI-based form design and display.

Components of the web application:

* There are three primary collections (Users and Books, Classes)
* Three main pages (Marketplace, Profile, Search) that uses the prior data collections and allows users to manipulate and filter through those collections.
* Code that fills the database with default data for Users, Books, and Classes. To demonstrate usage of the marketplace.
* A page to filter through different Classes and Books to query the collections to obtain a specific book.

## Pages

First of all, we want to include a landing page for our site. We would want it to include the title of our site as well as our purpose/mission.
