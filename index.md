## Overview
Books for Bows is a web application that provides a market place for students to buy and sell textbooks directly to other students. It is built with the technology stack that consists of:

* [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/) for Javascript-based implementation of client and server code.
* [React](https://reactjs.org/) for component-based UI implementation and routing.
* [Semantic UI React](https://react.semantic-ui.com/) CSS Framework for UI design.
* [Uniforms](https://uniforms.tools/) for React and Semantic UI-based form design and display.

You can view an early deployed version of the app here: [https://books-for-bows.meteorapp.com/](https://books-for-bows.meteorapp.com/)

Components of the web application:

* There are four primary collections (Users, Books, Classes, Listings)
* Three main pages (Marketplace, Profile, Search) that uses the prior data collections and allows users to manipulate and filter through those collections.
* Code that fills the database with default data for Users, Books, and Classes. To demonstrate usage of the marketplace.
* A page to filter through different Classes and Books to query the collections to obtain a specific book.

### Marketplace
Users will be able to see information about available textbook listings. Users don't need to be logged in to see this. If multiple users are selling the same book, only one card is shown. The card will display:
- Image of cover
- Title
- Author
- Price (or price range if there are multiple sellers)
- Course alphas that use the book
